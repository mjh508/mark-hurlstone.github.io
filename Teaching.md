# Legacy Teaching

## PSYC3302 Psychological Measurement and its Applications 
This unit introduces students to the theoretical and practical underpinnings of psychological measurement. Topics covered include the theoretical and empirical bases of reliability and validity, classical and contemporary approaches to reliability and validity, test biases, responses biases, item response theory, and applications of psychological measurement to intelligence and personality assessment. Teaching is by lectures (12×2 hours) and laboratory classes (12×2 hours). Evaluation is by laboratory report (25%), SPSS Lab Exam (25%), and final exam (50%).

## PSYC3310 Specialist Topics in Psychology
This unit focuses on providing students with the opportunity to learn about and perform research in a specialist topic area of psychology. Teaching is by seminars (10×2 hours) and tutorials (10×2 hours) which are delivered to a small class of between 20–30 students. Evaluation is by small scale research project report (60%), research proposal (15%), ethics application (5%), class participation and informal group presentation (10%), and formal group presentation (10%). I have delivered topics in this unit spanning a wide range of areas including: Principles of Short-term and Episodic Memory, Psychology and Climate Change, and Political Psychology. For the past few years I have delivered a topic on Behavioural Economics.
